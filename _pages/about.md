## About Me
I am currently a Master’s candidate in Dynamics of Renewables-Based Power Systems (DREAM), an Erasmus Mundus joint programme focused on the analysis, control, and planning of future low-carbon power systems dominated by power electronics.

 My work sits at the intersection of electrical power systems and mathematical optimization, with a focus on renewable energy integration, grid operation, and system-level decision-making, applying science and engineering to address economic and policy challenges for a clean and intelligent energy transition. 

## Short Bio

I received my Bachelor’s degree in Sustainable Development Engineering in Mexico, where I developed a strong foundation in large-scale energy projects and emerging power technologies. During my undergraduate studies, I participated in research on hybrid AC/DC grids and machine learning applications, including an academic research stay in China, where I worked on advanced control and fault prediction for LCC-HVDC systems.

Throughout my Master’s studies, I have followed an international academic path across France, Spain, and Eastern Europe, working on both academic and industry-oriented projects. Alongside my studies, I have contributed to energy systems optimization and data-driven modeling projects, including applications of artificial intelligence to electricity markets, forecasting, energy trading, and decision-support tools.

My professional objective is to contribute to the energy transition through technically rigorous work that supports system-level decisions in transmission and grid-integration contexts, within technology providers, system operators, or international energy institutions.

## Life Outside Work
Beyond my academic pursuits, I enjoy mountain hiking, strenght training and journaling.
