## About Me
I am currently a Master’s candidate in Dynamics of Renewables-Based Power Systems, a joint programme focused on the analysis, control, and planning of future low-carbon power systems dominated by power electronics.

My work sits at the intersection of electrical power systems and mathematical optimization, with a focus on renewable energy integration, grid operation, and system-level decision-making, applying science and engineering to address economic and policy challenges for a clean and intelligent energy transition. 

## Short Bio

I received my Bachelor’s degree in Sustainable Development Engineering in Mexico, where I developed a strong foundation in large-scale energy projects and power technologies. During my undergraduate studies, I engaged in research on HVDC systems and data-driven methods, including an academic research stay in China.

I have gained industry exposure through internships and collaborations in the energy and infrastructure sectors, including work with bp, Enel Green Power, and industrial R&D teams at electricity suppliers.

From 2023 to 2026, I have pursued an international academic path across China, France, Spain, and Eastern Europe, working on both academic and industry-oriented projects. My Master’s dissertation, “A Game-Theoretic Approach to Voltage Procurement,” is scheduled for defense in September 2026. In Spring 2026, I conducted research as a visiting scholar at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

Alongside my studies, I have worked on energy systems optimization and system-level modeling, with applications to electricity markets, forecasting, energy trading, and decision-support tools for power system operation.

My professional objective is to contribute to the energy transition through technically rigorous work that bridges engineering analysis with real-world system and policy constraints.

## Life Outside Work
Beyond my academic pursuits, I enjoy mountain hiking, strength training and journaling.
