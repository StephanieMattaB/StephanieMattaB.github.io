I am currently a Master’s student in Dynamics of Renewables-Based Power Systems (DREAM), an Erasmus Mundus joint programme focused on the analysis, control, and planning of future low-carbon power systems dominated by power electronics.

My academic work lies at the intersection of power systems, power electronics, and control, with a particular interest in converter-dominated grids, HVDC systems, grid-forming technologies, and transmission-level planning under technical and regulatory constraints. I am especially motivated by problems that connect mathematical modeling and system dynamics with real-world implementation and strategic decision-making in the energy transition.

I received my Bachelor’s degree in Sustainable Development Engineering in Mexico, where I developed a strong foundation in electrical engineering applied to energy systems. During my undergraduate studies, I collaborated on research related to renewable integration and power system control, including an academic research stay in China, where I worked on topics related to advanced control and fault prediction in electrical systems.

Throughout my master’s studies, I have pursued an internationally oriented path, studying and conducting research across France, Spain, and Eastern Europe, and engaging with both academic and industry-driven projects. Alongside my studies, I have worked on energy systems optimization and data-driven modeling, including projects related to electricity markets, forecasting, and decision-support tools for power system operation.

My professional goal is to contribute to the design and transformation of future power systems at the transmission and system-integration level, ideally within system operators, technology providers, or international energy institutions. I am particularly interested in roles that combine technical depth, system-level thinking, and strategic impact.
